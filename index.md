# What is this?
A series of open smart automation devices and software.

# Devices
All devices support WiFi and mesh networking.
Available devices are;
* [LD (LED Dimmer)](#LD-LED-Dimmer))
* ED (Embedded Dimmer)
* WD (Wall Dimmer)
* ET (Embedded Thermostat)
* WT (Wall Thermostat)
* WS (Wall Sensor)
* RC (Remote Controll)

## LD (LED Dimmer)
LED controller with two dimmer channels and two RGB channels.
The dimmer channels are for controlling any type of LED that uses 5-30VDC with a max total load of 10A (120W @ 12V or 240W @ 24V).
The RGB channels are for controlling addressable RGB LED strips.

## ED (Embedded Dimmer)
Dimmer with two channels for embedding in junction boxes. Accepts 90-264VAC with a max total load of 800W or 4A.
Features trailing edge dimming that eliminates the noise and current spikes that are common with common leading edge dimmers.
Features over voltage, over current and over temperature protection.
